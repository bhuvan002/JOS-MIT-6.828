Questions-
A1) To distinguish if error code has to be pushed inside or not. In some cases pushing the error code is needed for interrupt handling.
A2) No, nothing extra was needed. That is because user was executing a code that wasn't in its previlige level. Hence a trap 13 is expected.
A3) In arguments od SETGATE we need to set DPL = 3 intead of DPL =0 , otherwise we would have a general protection fault indicating that the user is trying to execute code that isn't in its previlege level.
A4) We enforce permissions by this. We should be careful about what calls to systems are made via exceptions, because through these we execute code at kernel level permisions from a user level previlige.
